# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
The goal of this project is to train various Machine Learning algorithms capable of classifying images of different hand gestures, such as a fist, palm, showing the thumb, and others. This classification can be useful for Gesture Navigation, for example.
Also this repo compares the accuracies of various algorithms on a given data.
